          The architects of Pakistan's destiny, its founding fathers, were
          visionary leaders who played an instrumental role in shaping the
          nation. Their unwavering determination, coupled with a deep
          understanding of the political, social, and cultural landscape, led to
          the creation of an independent homeland for the subcontinent's
          Muslims. These pioneers not only fought for the establishment of
          Pakistan but also laid the foundation for its democratic principles
          and Islamic ethos.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text fs-5">
          Their sacrifices and contributions to the nation-building process are
          immeasurable. The challenges they faced were immense, yet their
          perseverance and wisdom enabled them to overcome hurdles and establish
          a sovereign state. The principles and ideals they championed continue
          to be relevant today, serving as a guiding light for the nation. It is
          imperative to remember and honor their legacy, as it is through
          understanding their sacrifices that we can truly appreciate the
          significance of Pakistan's independence.

            <p>
              The War of Independence was the first major revolt against British
              rule, led by Indian soldiers. The rebellion, though ultimately
              unsuccessful, laid the groundwork for future resistance against
              British domination.

            <p>
              The Indian National Congress (INC) was established by Indian
              intellectuals, including Allan Octavian Hume and Dadabhai Naoroji,
              as a platform for voicing Indian concerns under British rule.
              Initially moderate, the INC would later evolve into the primary
              organization advocating for India's independence.

              The British government divided Bengal into two provinces: East
              Bengal with a Muslim majority and West Bengal with a Hindu
              majority. This move was opposed by many, including Surendranath
              Banerjee and other Congress leaders, as an attempt to divide and
              weaken the nationalist movement. The partition was annulled in
              1911 following widespread protests.

              political interests of Muslims in India. Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah,
              Aga Khan III, and Nawab Salimullah were among the founding
              members. The League sought to protect Muslim rights and later
              became the driving force behind the demand for Pakistan.

            <p>
              Due to sustained opposition led by both Hindu and Muslim leaders,
              the British government reversed the partition of Bengal in 1911.
              This was seen as a victory for Indian nationalism, although it
              also intensified Muslim concerns about their political future.

              The Lucknow Pact marked a historic agreement between the INC and
              the Muslim League. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was a member of both
              the Congress and the Muslim League, played a crucial role in
              bridging the gap between Hindus and Muslims. The pact agreed on
              separate electorates for Muslims, marking a significant step
              towards Hindu-Muslim unity for self-governance.

              to protect the Ottoman Caliphate and unite Indian Muslims. The
              movement received significant support from Gandhi, who saw it as
              an opportunity to bring Muslims into the broader independence
              struggle.

              India. The failure to reach an agreement on minority rights

              Jinnah and the Muslim League initially accepted the plan, but it
              ultimately failed due to disagreements with Congress over the
              nature of the central government. Nehru and other Congress leaders
              were wary of the provisions for separate Muslim-majority

              days. Congress leaders like Nehru became key figures in
              independent India, with Nehru becoming its first Prime Minister.
              The partition led to massive migrations, widespread communal
              violence, and the displacement of millions.
